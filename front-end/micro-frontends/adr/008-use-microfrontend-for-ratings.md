## Title: Implementation of Product Rating and Reviews as a Microfrontend

## Context:
The application requires functionality for users to view and submit ratings and reviews for products. This includes displaying average ratings, individual user reviews, and interactive features for rating products.

## Decision:
Implement the Product Rating and Reviews functionality as a separate microfrontend within the application architecture.

## Rationale:

Modularity: Implementing Product Rating and Reviews as a separate microfrontend promotes modularity and encapsulation, allowing for independent development, testing, and deployment cycles. This separation of concerns enhances maintainability and facilitates team autonomy.

Scalability: The microfrontend architecture allows for horizontal scaling of individual sections, including Product Rating and Reviews, to accommodate increased traffic or data volume without impacting other parts of the application.

Customization: A dedicated microfrontend for Product Rating and Reviews enables customization of the user interface, interaction patterns, and data presentation specific to product ratings and reviews, providing a tailored and intuitive experience for users.

Flexibility: The microfrontend approach allows for flexibility in technology stack, development methodologies, and release cadences, empowering teams to choose the most suitable tools and practices for implementing and managing the Product Rating and Reviews functionality.

## Implications:

Data Integration: Integration with backend services or APIs is necessary to retrieve and update product ratings and reviews data. APIs may need to be developed or extended to facilitate data synchronization and real-time updates.

User Authentication: Mechanisms for user authentication and authorization are required to ensure that only authorized users can submit reviews and ratings. Access controls and permissions handling should be implemented to enforce security and privacy requirements.

Performance Considerations: Careful attention should be given to performance optimization, including data fetching, caching strategies, and rendering performance, to ensure smooth and responsive interactions with product ratings and reviews across different devices and network conditions.

## Alternatives:

Integrated Component: Considered, but not chosen due to potential limitations in customization and scalability. Separating Product Rating and Reviews into a microfrontend offers greater flexibility and autonomy for development and maintenance.

Third-Party Review Platform: Discussed, but not chosen as the primary approach due to potential restrictions on customization, branding, and control over the review interface and data ownership.
