## Title: Integration of Saved Products Functionality in the Menu Bar

## Context:
The application includes functionality for users to save products for later viewing or purchasing. There is a proposal to integrate the Saved Products functionality directly into the menu bar of the application, rather than implementing it as a separate microfrontend or dedicated page.

## Decision:
Integrate the Saved Products functionality directly into the menu bar of the application instead of creating a dedicated page or microfrontend for it.

## Rationale:

User Convenience: Integrating the Saved Products functionality into the menu bar provides users with easy access to their saved items without navigating to a separate page. This streamlines the user experience and reduces friction in accessing saved products.

Space Optimization: By integrating the Saved Products functionality into the menu bar, valuable screen real estate is optimized. This ensures that users can access their saved items quickly without cluttering the interface with additional pages or sections.

Simplicity: Integrating Saved Products as a menu bar functionality simplifies the architecture and reduces complexity. There is no need to manage a separate microfrontend or dedicated page for saved products, leading to easier development, maintenance, and deployment.

## Implications:

User Interface Design: Design considerations should be given to the placement and visual representation of the Saved Products functionality within the menu bar to ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience.

Functionality Integration: Integration with backend services or databases is necessary to retrieve and display saved products accurately within the menu bar. APIs may need to be developed or extended to facilitate data synchronization and real-time updates.

Performance Considerations: Careful attention should be given to performance optimization, including data fetching and rendering, to ensure smooth and responsive interactions with saved products within the menu bar.

## Alternatives:

Dedicated Page or Microfrontend: Considered, but not chosen due to the simplicity and space optimization benefits of integrating Saved Products directly into the menu bar.
