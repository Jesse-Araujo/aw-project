## Title: Implementation of Featured Products Section

## Context:
The application homepage requires a section to showcase featured products. This section will display a curated selection of products that are highlighted for promotional or strategic purposes.

## Decision:
Implement a Featured Products section as part of the main frontend application rather than as a separate microfrontend.

## Rationale:

Simplicity: Incorporating the Featured Products section into the main frontend application reduces complexity by avoiding the need for additional microfrontend infrastructure, routing, and communication mechanisms.

Performance: Direct integration of the Featured Products section within the main frontend application minimizes overhead associated with inter-microfrontend communication, resulting in faster page loading times and improved performance.

Content Integration: Integrating the Featured Products section into the main frontend application allows for seamless integration with existing content management systems (CMS) or data sources, streamlining content management and updating processes.

Consistency: Maintaining the Featured Products section within the main frontend application ensures consistency in design, layout, and user experience across different sections of the homepage.

## Implications:

Content Management: Content management processes need to be established to enable the dynamic selection and updating of featured products, potentially involving integration with backend systems or CMS platforms.

Scalability: Consideration should be given to the scalability of the main frontend application to accommodate potential increases in traffic and product catalog size as the platform grows.

Versioning: Changes to the Featured Products section may require versioning of the main frontend application to ensure backward compatibility and minimize disruption to other parts of the system.

## Alternatives:

Microfrontend Approach: Considered, but not chosen due to the relative simplicity and lower overhead of incorporating the Featured Products section directly into the main frontend application.

API Integration: Discussed, but not chosen as the primary approach due to potential limitations in flexibility and customization compared to direct integration within the frontend application.
