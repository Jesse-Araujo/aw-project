## Title: Implementation of Supermarket as a Microfrontend

## Context:
The application requires functionality to display comprehensive information about supermarkets, including location, categories of products, operating hours, contact details, and special offers. Users should be able to access this information seamlessly within the application.

## Decision:
Implement the Supermarket Information functionality as a separate microfrontend within the application architecture.

## Rationale:

Modularity: Implementing Supermarket Information as a separate microfrontend promotes modularity and encapsulation, allowing for independent development, testing, and deployment cycles. This separation of concerns enhances maintainability and facilitates team autonomy.

Scalability: The microfrontend architecture allows for horizontal scaling of individual sections, including Supermarket Information, to accommodate increased traffic or data volume without impacting other parts of the application.

Customization: A dedicated microfrontend for Supermarket Information enables customization of the user interface, interaction patterns, and data presentation specific to supermarket details, providing a tailored and intuitive experience for users.

Flexibility: The microfrontend approach allows for flexibility in technology stack, development methodologies, and release cadences, empowering teams to choose the most suitable tools and practices for implementing and managing the Supermarket Information functionality.

## Implications:

Data Integration: Integration with backend services or APIs is necessary to retrieve and update comprehensive supermarket information, including location data, product categories, operating hours, contact details, and special offers. APIs may need to be developed or extended to facilitate data synchronization and real-time updates.

User Authentication: Mechanisms for user authentication and authorization are required to ensure that only authorized users can access certain supermarket details, such as special offers or promotions. Access controls and permissions handling should be implemented to enforce security and privacy requirements.

Performance Considerations: Careful attention should be given to performance optimization, including data fetching, caching strategies, and rendering performance, to ensure smooth and responsive interactions with comprehensive supermarket information across different devices and network conditions.

## Alternatives:

Integrated Component: Considered, but not chosen due to potential limitations in customization and scalability. Separating Supermarket Information into a microfrontend offers greater flexibility and autonomy for development and maintenance.

Third-Party Data Integration: Discussed, but not chosen as the primary approach due to potential restrictions on data access, customization, and control over the supermarket information interface and data ownership.
