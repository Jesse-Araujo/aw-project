## Title: Implementation of Customer Support Functionality as a Microfrontend

## Context:
The application requires functionality for customer support, allowing users to access assistance, report issues, and receive timely responses to inquiries or problems. There is a proposal to implement the Customer Support functionality as a separate microfrontend within the application architecture.

## Decision:
To be determined based on further analysis of the Customer Support functionality and its integration within the application architecture.

## Rationale:

Modularity: Implementing Customer Support as a microfrontend promotes modularity and encapsulation, allowing for independent development, testing, and deployment cycles. This separation of concerns enhances maintainability and facilitates team autonomy.

Scalability: The microfrontend architecture allows for horizontal scaling of individual sections, including the Customer Support functionality, to accommodate increased support requests or usage without impacting other parts of the application.

Flexibility: A microfrontend approach offers flexibility in technology stack, development methodologies, and release cadences. It empowers teams to choose the most suitable tools and practices for implementing and managing the Customer Support functionality.

## Implications:

Integration Complexity: Integration with other parts of the application, such as user authentication and data retrieval components, may introduce additional complexity. Careful attention should be given to integration points to ensure seamless functionality.

User Experience: Design considerations should be given to the layout, navigation, and user interaction patterns of the Customer Support microfrontend to ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience.

Performance Considerations: Performance optimization, including response time and data processing, is crucial for a smooth customer support experience. Performance testing and optimization should be conducted to ensure optimal performance.

## Alternatives:

Integrated Component: Considered, but not chosen due to potential limitations in modularity and scalability. Implementing Customer Support as a microfrontend offers greater flexibility and autonomy for development and maintenance.
