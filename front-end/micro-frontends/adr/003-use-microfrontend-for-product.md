## Title: Product Component Implementation Decision

## Context:
The application requires a component to display product information, including details such as name, price, description, and image.

## Decision:
Implement a dedicated product component to handle the display and management of product information.

## Rationale:

Modularity: Creating a separate product component promotes modularity by encapsulating product-related logic and UI elements into a single reusable unit, facilitating maintainability and code organization.

Reusability: A dedicated product component allows for the reuse of product-related functionality across multiple parts of the application, such as product listings, search results, and individual product pages.

Scalability: By isolating product-related functionality, the application becomes more scalable, enabling easier addition of new features and modifications to existing ones without affecting other parts of the system.

Consistency: Utilizing a consistent product component ensures uniformity in the presentation and behavior of product information throughout the application, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Implications:

Data Flow: Clear data flow mechanisms need to be established to ensure seamless communication between the product component and other parts of the application, such as data fetching, state management, and event handling.

Customization: The product component may need to support customization options to accommodate varying product types, layouts, and display requirements.

Performance: Careful optimization is required to maintain optimal performance, especially when rendering large numbers of products or handling dynamic updates.

## Alternatives:

Inline Rendering: Considered, but rejected due to potential code duplication, decreased maintainability, and lack of reusability.

External Library: Discussed, but not chosen to maintain greater control over functionality, reduce dependencies, and ensure alignment with specific project requirements.
