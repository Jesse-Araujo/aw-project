## Title: Integration of Profile and Settings Modules within the Menu Microfrontend

## Context:
The application includes functionality for profile management, and settings customization. There's a proposal to integrate the Profile and Settings modules within the existing Menu microfrontend, allowing users to access these features seamlessly from the homepage.

## Decision:
Integrate the Profile and Settings modules within the Menu microfrontend to provide users with seamless access to their profile and settings directly from the homepage.

## Rationale:

Simplicity: Integrating Profile and Settings within the Menu microfrontend simplifies the architecture by consolidating related functionality into a single module. This approach reduces complexity in development, deployment, and maintenance tasks.

User Experience: Having the Profile and Settings accessible from the homepage via a menu bar provides a seamless user experience. Users can access and manage their profile and settings conveniently without navigating to separate pages or modules.

Efficiency: Integrating Profile and Settings within the Menu microfrontend improves efficiency by minimizing network requests and reducing the overhead associated with loading additional microfrontends. This streamlined approach enhances responsiveness and performance.

## Implications:

User Interface Design: The design of the Menu microfrontend needs to accommodate Profile and Settings functionality seamlessly. Design considerations include the layout, navigation, and user interaction patterns to ensure a cohesive and intuitive user experience.

## Alternatives:

Separate Microfrontends: Considered, but not chosen due to the potential complexity and overhead of managing multiple microfrontends. Integrating Profile and Settings within the Menu microfrontend offers a more streamlined and cohesive solution.
