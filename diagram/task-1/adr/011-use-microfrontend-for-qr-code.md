## Title: Implementation of QR Code Functionality as a Microfrontend

## Context:
The application requires functionality to scan types of meat in supermarkets and display them in the app using QR codes. This functionality needs to be modular, allowing for independent development, testing, and deployment cycles.

## Decision:
Implement the QR Code functionality as a separate microfrontend within the application architecture.

## Rationale:

Modularity: The QR Code functionality is relatively complex and independent, requiring separate development and maintenance cycles. Implementing it as a microfrontend promotes modularity and encapsulation, enabling teams to work on it independently.

Scalability: A microfrontend architecture allows for horizontal scaling of individual sections, including the QR Code functionality, to accommodate increased usage or updates without impacting other parts of the application.

Team Autonomy: Assigning a dedicated team or individual responsibility for the QR Code microfrontend enhances team autonomy and agility. This allows for specialized expertise and focused development efforts.

Future Extensibility: Implementing the QR Code functionality as a microfrontend provides flexibility for future enhancements and updates. It can evolve independently based on changing requirements without affecting other parts of the application.

## Implications:

Integration Complexity: Integration with other parts of the application, such as data retrieval and display components, may introduce additional complexity. Careful attention should be given to integration points to ensure seamless functionality.

Performance Considerations: Performance optimization, including QR code scanning speed and data processing, is crucial for a smooth user experience. Performance testing and optimization should be conducted to ensure optimal performance.

Security: Security measures, such as authentication and authorization, are essential for protecting sensitive data accessed or displayed through the QR Code functionality. Robust security mechanisms should be implemented to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.

## Alternatives:

Integrated Component: Considered, but not chosen due to the complexity and independence of the QR Code functionality. Implementing it as a microfrontend offers greater modularity and flexibility.
