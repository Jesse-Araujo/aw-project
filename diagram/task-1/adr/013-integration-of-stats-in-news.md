## Title: Integration of Stats Functionality within News Component

## Context:
The application includes functionality for providing statistical data related to news articles, such as views, likes, and shares. Initially, there was a proposal to implement the Stats functionality as a separate microfrontend, but there's a suggestion to integrate it within the existing News component instead.

## Decision:
Integrate the Stats functionality within the News component instead of implementing it as a separate microfrontend.

## Rationale:

User Context: Placing the Stats functionality within the News component provides users with relevant statistical data in context, enhancing their understanding and engagement with the content. Users can easily access statistics related to specific articles without navigating to a separate page or component.

Simplicity: Integrating the Stats functionality within the News component simplifies the user interface and navigation flow. It eliminates the need for users to switch between different sections or components to access related information, reducing cognitive load and improving usability.

Consistency: Integrating the Stats functionality within the News component maintains consistency in the user interface and interaction patterns. Users can expect to find statistical data in a centralized location, enhancing predictability and learnability.

Efficiency: Combining the Stats functionality with the News component optimizes resource utilization and performance. It reduces the overhead associated with managing multiple microfrontends and improves data sharing and communication between functionalities.

## Implications:

Component Design: Design considerations should be given to the layout and presentation of statistical data within the News component. Clear visualization techniques, such as charts or graphs, can help users interpret and understand the data effectively.

Backend Integration: Integration with backend services or data sources is necessary to retrieve and update statistical data related to news articles. APIs or database queries may need to be implemented to support this functionality seamlessly.

User Feedback: User feedback and testing should be conducted to validate the effectiveness of integrating the Stats functionality within the News component. Iterative improvements may be needed based on user behavior and preferences.

## Alternatives:

Implement as a Separate Microfrontend: The alternative considered was to implement the Stats functionality as a separate microfrontend. However, this approach was not chosen due to the benefits of integrating it within the existing News component, including simplicity, consistency, and efficiency.
