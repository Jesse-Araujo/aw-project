## Title: Auth Micro-Frontend Decision

## Context:
Project demands a streamlined, modular approach for user authentication.

## Decision:
Adopt a micro-frontend for login functionality.

## Rationale:

Simplicity: Simplifies codebase by isolating login logic within its own micro-frontend, enhancing readability and maintainability.

Single Responsibility: Focuses solely on login tasks, adhering to the principle of single responsibility and minimizing code complexity.

Reusability: Encapsulates login functionality for potential reuse across multiple applications or modules within the project.

Independent Deployment: Enables separate deployment of the login micro-frontend, allowing for agile updates without affecting other parts of the system.

Autonomous Teams: Facilitates independent development and deployment by dedicated teams, fostering autonomy and agility.

Vertical Services: Aligns with the project's vertical service architecture, enabling fine-grained control and scalability.

Flexibility: Allows for flexibility in technology choices and updates, accommodating future requirements and innovations.

## Implications:

Increased development overhead initially, but leads to long-term simplicity and agility. Requires clear communication and coordination between teams.

## Alternatives:
A monolithic approach would sacrifice modularity and flexibility. Third-party authentication services may limit customization and control.
