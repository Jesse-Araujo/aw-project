## Title: Implementation of Bottom Menu Bar

## Context:
The application requires a navigation mechanism to allow users to quickly access different sections or features of the app.

## Decision:
Implement a bottom menu bar to serve as the primary navigation component.

## Rationale:

User Convenience: Placing the menu at the bottom of the screen makes it easily accessible to users, especially on larger smartphones where reaching the top of the screen can be cumbersome.

Consistency: Bottom menu bars are a common navigation pattern in mobile applications, providing familiarity to users and aligning with platform conventions.

Visibility: Placing navigation options at the bottom ensures they remain visible even when content is scrolled, improving discoverability and usability.
Space Optimization: Utilizing the bottom area of the screen for navigation minimizes interference with content and maximizes screen real estate for displaying essential information.

Responsive Design: Bottom menu bars adapt well to various screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
Implications:

UI/UX Design: Requires careful design consideration to ensure the menu items are visually appealing, easily identifiable, and logically organized for intuitive navigation.

Development Effort: Implementation of the bottom menu bar will require frontend development effort to integrate it into the app's layout and functionality.
Testing: Comprehensive testing is needed to verify the responsiveness, accessibility, and compatibility of the bottom menu bar across different devices and screen sizes.

## Implications:

Visual Hierarchy: The bottom menu bar establishes a visual hierarchy, potentially impacting the perception of the application's structure and organization.

Interaction Design: Careful consideration is needed to ensure intuitive interaction design, such as touch targets and feedback, to enhance usability and prevent user errors.

Platform Guidelines: Adherence to platform-specific design guidelines (e.g., Material Design for Android, Human Interface Guidelines for iOS) may be necessary to maintain a consistent user experience across platforms.

## Alternatives:

Side Navigation Drawer: Considered as an alternative, but deemed less suitable due to decreased visibility and accessibility.

Top Navigation Bar: Another option, but dismissed in favor of the bottom menu bar for improved user ergonomics and platform consistency.

## Notes:
Additional considerations may include the specific menu items to include in the bottom menu bar, such as Home, Favorites, QR Code, News and Profile. Regular user feedback and usability testing should inform any future adjustments or enhancements to the bottom menu bar.
