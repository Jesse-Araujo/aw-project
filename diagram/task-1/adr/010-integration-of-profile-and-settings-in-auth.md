## Title: Integration of Profile and Settings Modules within the Login Microfrontend

## Context:
The application includes functionality for user authentication, profile management, and settings customization. There's a proposal to integrate the Profile and Settings modules within the existing Login microfrontend, allowing users to access these features seamlessly from the homepage.

## Decision:
Integrate the Profile and Settings modules within the Login microfrontend to provide users with seamless access to their profile and settings directly from the homepage.

## Rationale:

Simplicity: Integrating Profile and Settings within the Login microfrontend simplifies the architecture by consolidating related functionality into a single module. This approach reduces complexity in development, deployment, and maintenance tasks.

User Experience: Having the Profile and Settings accessible from the homepage via a menu bar provides a seamless user experience. Users can access and manage their profile and settings conveniently without navigating to separate pages or modules.

Efficiency: Integrating Profile and Settings within the Login microfrontend improves efficiency by minimizing network requests and reducing the overhead associated with loading additional microfrontends. This streamlined approach enhances responsiveness and performance.

Shared State: Integration within the Login microfrontend allows for easy sharing of authentication state and user context between the login, profile, and settings modules. This facilitates consistent user experiences and simplifies data management.

## Implications:

User Interface Design: The design of the Login microfrontend needs to accommodate Profile and Settings functionality seamlessly. Design considerations include the layout, navigation, and user interaction patterns to ensure a cohesive and intuitive user experience.

Security: Security measures, such as access control, data protection, and secure transmission of sensitive information, should be implemented within the Login microfrontend to safeguard user data accessed through the Profile and Settings modules.

## Alternatives:

Separate Microfrontends: Considered, but not chosen due to the potential complexity and overhead of managing multiple microfrontends. Integrating Profile and Settings within the Login microfrontend offers a more streamlined and cohesive solution.
