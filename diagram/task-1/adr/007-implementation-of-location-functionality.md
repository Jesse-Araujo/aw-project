## Title: Implementation of Location Functionality with Supermarket Map Integration

## Context:
The application requires location functionality to enable users to locate supermarkets on a map within the application. This functionality aims to enhance the user experience by providing visual representation and navigation capabilities for nearby supermarkets.

## Decision:
Utilize an API-based approach for supermarket location functionality instead of implementing it as a separate microfrontend within the application architecture.

## Rationale:

Simplicity: Implementing supermarket location functionality through an API simplifies development and reduces architectural complexity. It avoids the need for additional microfrontend infrastructure, routing, and communication mechanisms.

Efficiency: An API-based approach allows for efficient integration with existing mapping services (e.g., Google Maps, Mapbox) without the overhead of maintaining a separate microfrontend. It streamlines development efforts and reduces maintenance costs.

Scalability: Leveraging mapping APIs provides scalability benefits, as these services are designed to handle large volumes of requests and can scale horizontally to accommodate increased traffic or data volume.

Flexibility: Using mapping APIs offers flexibility in technology stack and development methodologies. It empowers teams to choose the most suitable tools and practices for integrating location functionality into the application.

## Implications:

API Integration: Integration with mapping APIs (e.g., Google Maps API, Mapbox API) is necessary to retrieve and display supermarket locations on the map. Authentication keys and permissions may be required to access map data and services.

Geolocation Services: Mechanisms for retrieving and updating user location data may still be needed to provide accurate location-based services and recommendations. Permissions handling and user consent mechanisms should be implemented to ensure compliance with privacy regulations.

Performance Considerations: Careful attention should be given to performance optimization, including data fetching, caching strategies, and map rendering, to ensure smooth and responsive map interactions across different devices and network conditions.

## Alternatives:

Embedded Map Component: Considered, but not chosen due to potential limitations in customization and scalability. Utilizing mapping APIs offers greater flexibility and scalability for integrating location functionality.

Third-Party Map Widget: Discussed, but not chosen as the primary approach due to potential restrictions on customization, branding, and control over the map interface and functionality.

Microfrontend: Implementing location functionality as a separate microfrontend was considered but not chosen due to the relatively simple nature of the feature and the availability of efficient API-based solutions.
